YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis Web App
This project is a modern, dark-themed Flask web application for analyzing the sentiment of YouTube video comments. It started as a simple Colab script and was transformed into a full-featured, user-friendly web app with a beautiful interface.

Visualizes sentiment distribution with interactive bar, pie, or count charts (matplotlib/seaborn).

Features a modern, dark-mode web interface built with Flask, HTML, and custom CSS.
